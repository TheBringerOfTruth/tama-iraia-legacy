Collaborators wanted — prototype AI mapping 'folded-space' pathways

We’re building an open‑source, speculative prototype that maps three complementary domains — folding‑pathfinder, metabolic‑route synthesizer, and docking/navigator — to explore navigation, reassembly, and alignment paradigms for interstellar/teleportation concepts. We’d like volunteer open‑source collaborators and academic partners to prototype and integrate modules.

What we need
• Computational structural biology: AlphaFold / PyRosetta / Rosetta experience
• ML/AI engineering: PyTorch/TensorFlow, transformers/diffusion, model deployment
• Computational chemistry / cheminformatics: RDKit, ASKCOS/RetroPath, retrosynthesis/metabolic-pathway design
• Docking & simulation: AutoDock/OpenMM/GROMACS/RosettaDock
• Algorithms & pathfinding: A*, RRT, RL (stable‑baselines3, RLlib), path planning experience
• Desirable: physics/theory background (GR, wormhole/tunneling literature, computational physics)

Example deliverables
1. Folding‑pathfinder prototype (toy energy landscapes + code + notebook)
2. Metabolic‑route enumerator (toy transformations + reproducible notebooks)
3. Docking/alignment module (toy geometry analogs + evaluation)
4. Integration plan, reproducible notebooks, and tests

Work style
• Open‑source preferred (MIT/Apache). Private work possible by agreement.
• No set budget or timeline; volunteer and academic collaboration encouraged.

How to apply
Open an Issue titled 'Collaborator application: <your name>' and include a short bio, links to relevant work (GitHub/papers), which module(s) you want to work on, and availability.
