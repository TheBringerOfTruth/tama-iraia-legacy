Welcome to the tama-iraia-legacy project â€” thank you for your interest in collaborating.

Vision
We are exploring a speculative, interdisciplinary prototype that maps analogies between protein folding, metabolic retrosynthesis, and docking to investigate navigation, reassembly, and alignment paradigms for interstellar/teleportation concepts. This repository hosts starter code and experiments; contributions are welcome.

How to contribute
- Pick an open issue or open a new issue describing your idea.
- Fork the repository and create a branch named feature/<short-description>.
- Write clear, well-documented code and include tests or reproducible notebooks where appropriate.
- Submit a pull request against the main branch. PRs will be reviewed and may be iterated on.

Coding standards
- Use Python 3.9+.
- Follow PEP8; run tools such as black and flake8 where possible.
- Prefer clear notebooks for exploratory work; include scripts for reproducibility.

Environment & reproducibility
- Use Docker or provide a requirements.txt/conda environment.yml for reproducibility.
- Include example inputs and expected outputs for experiments.

Communication
- Use Issues for bugs and feature requests and the Discussions tab for open-ended collaboration and design discussions.
- Label your issues clearly ("help wanted", "good first issue", "research", "ml", "chemistry").

Licensing & data
- The project is open-source; default to permissive licensing (MIT or Apache-2.0) unless otherwise agreed.
- Do not include private or sensitive data in the repository.

Code of conduct
- Be respectful and constructive. If a formal Code of Conduct is needed, we will add one; until then, treat contributors with professionalism.

Contact
- To apply as a collaborator, open an Issue titled "Collaborator application: <your name>" and include a short bio, links to relevant work (GitHub/papers), and availability.
